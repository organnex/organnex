	<h1>Composting</h1>
        <p class="lead">Composting is the act of creating more soil by `recycling` scrap plant matter back into the Earth where it is broken down into organic matter. Using worms greatly reduces the amount of composting time and yields a nutrient rich compost call castings (worm poop).</p>

<p>Be sure to read the list of acceptable and unacceptable materials to ensure the best compost for your garden.</p>

<p>Here's a short list of links to shed light on vermicompost/vermiculture.</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.wormpoop.com/" target="_blank">Worm Poop</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compost#Vermicompost" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></li>

</ul>

<p>Vermicompost and vermiculture are interchangeable terms. To grow out a worm bed, that is to allow your worm population to increase, you have to feed them. This is vermiculture. It results in high quality compost called vermicompost to communicate that it's from worms.</p>

<p>Here are some resources to help you get started with composting.</p>

<ul class="generic">
	<li><a href="http://www.compost-info-guide.com/index.htm" target="_blank">Compost Info Guide</a> is a great place for practical information.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.howtocompost.org/" target="_blank">How to Compost</a> contains the usual mix of information and resources.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.rodale.com/search/google_appliance/Compost" target="_blank">The new Rodale.com website has many tips on how to use compost.</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.mariasfarmcountrykitchen.com/how-to-start-a-compost-pile-in-4-easy-steps/" target="_blank">How to Start a Compost Pile in 4 Easy Steps</a> from Maria Rodale. Her method is what I use: simple.</li>
</ul>

<p>From the Rodale Book of Composting is this simple graphic showing what you can compost:<br />
<img alt="Compost Materials" src="assets/images/compost-materials.png" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Government agencies support compost, and have good information about how to do it:</p>

<ul class="generic">
	<li>The <a href="http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/rrr/composting/index.htm" target="_blank">EPA's RRR website</a> has a solid overview.</li>
	<li>Do check out the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/rrr/composting/basic.htm" target="_blank">EPA's Basic Compost Information page.</a> I agree with everything there except the very last sentence. Compost kills weed seeds. Not all of them but a very large majority of them</li>
	<li>Local to OrgAnnex's region, the <a href="http://www.denvergov.org/recoth/CompostingCollectionPilotProgram/BenefitsofComposting/tabid/433350/Default.aspx" target="_blank">city of Denver has a conservative compost page</a> with links.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do it right, composting does not smell at all. If you uncover a portion of decomposing organic material it will smell because it's not yet fully composted. That said, be sure you chop your compost materials as finely as possible. The bigger the chunk the longer it takes to compost.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermicompost" target="_blank">Vermiculture</a> is the practice of composting with worms. It's very fast; your compost pile will break down much quicker with worms than without. You can even compost your garbage indoors without a mess and without odor of any kind save for that of fresh dirt. Worm composting rules!</p>

<p>In Colorado you can't find a better expert than John of <a href="http://www.cowormman.com/" target="_blank">Wormbulance</a> fame. OrgAnnex is glad to see <a href="http://amazon.com/dp/0878579915" target="_blank">The Rodale Book of Composting</a> listed on John's site. This is the one book I wish were a complete website. It has absolutely everything you need to know about composting. After reading it you might conclude as OrgAnnex does: composting can save the world.</p>

<h3>Here are more benefits of composting</h3>

<ul class="compost">
	<li>Compost is more than a fertilizer, more than a soil conditioner. It's the symbol and means of a continuing life. Nature has been making compost eons before humans first walked the Earth.</li>
	<li>Compost improves soil texture and structure, qualities that enable the soil to retain nutrients, moisture, and air for the support of healthy crops.</li>
	<li>By increasing the soil's moisture-holding capacity, compost helps control erosion and otherwise would wash topsoil into waterways.</li>
	<li>Compost is the best recycler of biological wastes, turning millions of tons of our refuse into a sustainable and resilient food-growing asset.</li>
	<li>Compost provides and releases plant nutrients, protects against drought, controls pH, supports essential bacteria, feeds helpful earthworms, stops nutrient loss through leaching, acts as a buffer against toxins in the soil, controls weeds, and conserves a nation's nonrenewable energy resources.</li>
	<li>When waste is disposed of by biological means (composting) plant nutrients are conserved to the advantage of your garden.</li>
	<li>Compost builds good soil structure. Good structure allows a soil to breathe and facilitates circulation. Heavy clay soil - such as what we have in Colorado - tends to become waterlogged quickly, preventing water and air penetration.</li>
	<li>Sandy soils, which tend to let water drain away too rapidly, are rebuilt by the addition of compost. The fine particles are united into larger ones that can hold greater quantities of water in films on their surfaces.</li>
	<li>The higher the humus content, the more moisture a soil can absorb and retain. Humus is a complicated organic substance created and held together by fungi. It is broken down by bacteria in the final phase of composting.</li>
	<li>Soil improved with compost holds more moisture. Water is soaked up like a sponge and stored on the granules (structure). Structure is built by soil fungi and bacteria.</li>
	<li>Erosion is the end results of a gradual loss of soil fertility. Composts helps build good structure that encourages optimum fertility and resist erosion. Really fertile soil is very resistant to erosion - that is soil as nature intended it to be.</li>
	<li>Erosion can deplete soil fertility with amazing rapidity. Composts plays and integral role in the fight against erosion.</li>
	<li>Aeration is extremely important to soil health. Air plays a vital role in the maintenance of soil productivity. Without air, soils tend to become alkaline, organic matter content decreases, and active humus deactivated.</li>
	<li>Compost helps build soil structure that allows for optimum aeration at all times. Soil can breathe, and it needs to.</li>
	<li>Just as organic matter enables soils to hold more water through the enhanced formation of soil aggregates (structure), it also allows more spaces for air between soil granules.</li>
	<li>Compost is an excellent vehicle for carrying nutrients to your soil and plants. In a well executed compost, your garden will need no other form of fertilization.</li>
	<li>Naturally occurring nutrients in compost are released slowly at a rate which the plants can use them most profitably for optimum growth. Chemical fertilizers release their nutrients all at once and are leached off by water; they are available for a very short period of time.</li>
</ul>

  <h1><a href="benefits-of-vermiculture.html">Benefits of Vermiculture</a></h1>
   

<p>Rather than pay someone to haul away and profit from your compostables, let OrgAnnex set up your own vermicompost operation so you can enjoy the benefits.</p>

<ul class="bullet-orange">
  <h3>Vermicomposting is</h3>
  <li><strong>Faster</strong>
  <p>2-4 weeks until you can start using it.</p>

</li>

<li><strong>Richer</strong>
  <p>Worm castings contain 5-11 times more nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. You get a healthier organic garden sooner.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>More beneficial micro-organisms and plant growth hormones</strong>

  <p>Better for your garden and indoor plants; better tasting veggies because they are healthier and growing optimally with minimal environmental stressors. Healthier landscape plants and lawns because they are fed nutrients that they can use, and nutrients that stick around naturally.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Less effort</strong>
  <p>Feed the worms and let them do their thing. No need to turn the pile over, no need to manage it except when you need to harvest the castings.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Onsite and Indoors</strong>
  <p>Year round composting, even in winter. Yes, you can actually grow cold hardy veggies throughout winter! Enjoy fresh greens, awesome spinach and candy carrots! Winter temps increases the starch in carrots, making them very tasty and sweet! And don't forget about trees: their roots grow in winter; they need nutrients and water.</p>

</li>

<li><strong>Year round use</strong>
  <p>Since you're getting fresh compost weekly, use it weekly to build up an organic garden far sooner; use it as organic mulch directly on landscape and lawns.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>How vermicompost conserves water and energy</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Organic soil is soil that doesn't have any chemicals in it.</li>
  <li>Because there aren't synthetic chemicals, the soil has excellent structure.</li>
<li>Excellent structure means the soil retains water and still allows air down to the roots.</li>
<li>Air is 78% nitrogen. Plants need nitrogen in order to grow. </li>
<li>Organic nitrogen is nitrogen that has been "fixed" from the air into the soil by excellent soil structure.</li>
<li>That soil structure is excellent because it contains many beneficial soil organisms. (synthetics kill them).</li>
<li>Those soil organisms actually break down the nitrogen into forms that the plant roots can use.</li>
<li><strong>Vermicompost results in healthy plants that use less water and energy.</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>Traditional Composting</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Slower
	<p>3 - 18 months</p>
	</li>
	<li>Poorer
	<p>Not as rich in nutrients</p>
	</li>
	<li>Less Benefits
	<p>Not as many beneficial micro-organism as vermicompost</p>
	</li>
	<li>More Effort
	<p>One must manage the compost pile every few days</p>
	</li>
	<li>Outdoors
	<p>Regardless of scale, one can't manage a compost pile in winter in freezing weather</p>
	</li>
	<li>Fair weather use
	<p>You can only get and use the compost Spring through Fall. But who really uses compost in the Fall?</p>

<hr />
<p>With these differences, why do people choose traditional compost?</p>

<p>More than likely their business model is tied to the garbage model: haul it away.</p>

<p>Hauling it away and composting it on their site raises of a lot of issues.</p>

<ol class="number-pad">
	<li>It doesn't close the loop</li>
	<li>Requires more energy costs</li>
	<li>Therefore it isn't sustainable;</li>
	<li>and it isn't resilient</li>
</ol>

<p>Haul away composting programs don't directly benefit the source of the raw compost. In fact, I would go so far as to say that traditional composting companies should actually pay their sources for the compostables, not the other way around.</p>

<p>With an expanding worm population, it was time to make the
bin less crowded and feed my plants with the nutrient rich worm castings.</p>
<p>In the greenhouse I pulled the weaker tomato plants out to
  install my second vermicompost area. Boy does the soil in there need it! I
think you can literally see why I went heavy on the organic fish fertilizer
this year. </p>
<img src="assets/images/soil-with-worms-from-coffee.jpg" alt="worms from the vermicompost bin" />

<p class="note">Right below these few worms was a roiling mass of worms. </p>
<p>I used my trusty spading fork to break up this dirt for
  about the 5<sup>th</sup> time in a year. This clay is almost as hard as
concrete, and the fertilizer broke it up just a little bit. There are no worms
of any kind in this soil. Well, these red wrigglers are going to bust it up a
lot.</p>

<img src="assets/images/sterile-clay-chunks.jpg" alt="sterile clay chunks of useless dirt" />

<p>The reason Iâve switched over to vermicompost is because
  itâs quicker, richer and rewarding. In just 3 months time I will have the entire greenhouse converted to a rich loam by feeding the worms (vermiculture) enough to double their population every 2 weeks. This exponential growth is easily achieved with the food scraps from 3 people. The soil will once again befertile.</p>

<p>I read somewhere online that itâs a good practice to compost
  the tomato vines right where they grew. To that end I have vines, green and rotting tomatoes along with some worm smoothie in a garbage can that should be unholy mess in a week or so. But spading the ground and feeding it, the worms will follow after the food.</p>


<img src="assets/images/pit-for-worms-in-greenhouse.jpg" alt="a 4 foot long pit where I need to improve the soil" />

<p class="note">The first of 12 pits to improve the greenhouse soil over the next 3 months. With traditional composting it would take two to three years to improve this typical Front Range clay soil.</p>

<p class="note">Notes:<br />Having the vermicompost bin inside is very handy, especially in winter. You can have  a fully functioning vermicompost outside in winter as long as you keep it very well
insulated. John uses old refrigerators turned on their backs.</p>

          <p>Winter arrived 2 weeks ago. Consistently below freezing temps requires I move my worms into the greenhouse where they will double in size and numbers over the next 2 months.</p>

          <h3>Highest Life Forms</h3>
          <p>Worms are the top tier of the compost cycle of life. Bacteria, fungi, nematodes, actinomycetes and many others are the first- and second-tier consumers of wastes. The comprise what I call Soil Organisms. They are the <a href="soil-micro-organisms-are-the-highest-life-form-on-earth.html">highest life forms on Earth</a>. Without them we do not have plants. Without plants, there would be no animals, and certainly no humans.</p>

I chop it up every other day. It takes about a week to fill up the bucket. It really helps your composting operation to eat lots of organic fruits and veggies. Worms also love coffee grinds, but I keep a separate traditional compost pile for most of my grinds. Blueberries love acid compost that coffee grinds make.</p>
